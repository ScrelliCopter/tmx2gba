# tmx2gba #
tmx2gba is a simple command line utility that converts [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) .tmx maps to Game Boy Advance formatted charmaps.

### Features ###
* Export raw charmaps that can be easily memcpy'd into VRAM.
* Preserves tile flipping.
* Supports per-tile palette specification.
* Custom collision layer support.
* Support for objects with id mapping.

## Usage ##
```
tmx2gba [-hv] [-r offset] [-lyc name] [-p 0-15] [-m name;id] <-i inpath> <-o outpath>
```

| -f <file>    | No       | Flag file containing command-line arguments for easy integration with buildscripts |

## Building ##

Dependencies for building are CMake 3.15 and a C++20 compliant compiler,
all other dependencies are in-tree so you should be able to build with:
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build
```

Optionally, you may install it to use it system wide:
```bash
sudo cmake --install build
```
Which will copy the tmx2gba executable to /usr/local/bin/tmx2gba by default,
`--prefix /usr` can be used to override install location.

If you're a devkitPro user and would prefer to keep all your development tools compartmentalised
you may optionally install to the tools directory with the `TMX2GBA_DKP_INSTALL` option (OFF by default).
The build scripts will respect your `DEVKITPRO` environment variable but if not set will install to
`/opt/devkitpro/tools/bin/tmx2gba` directly, the `--prefix` argument has no effect in this mode.
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTMX2GBA_DKP_INSTALL:BOOL=ON
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

### Todo list ###
* Add support for multi-SBB prepared charmaps.
* Check if this works for NDS as well.
* Compression support.
