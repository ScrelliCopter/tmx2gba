# tmx2gba #
tmx2gba is a simple command line utility that converts [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) .tmx maps to Game Boy Advance compatible charmaps.
Originally developed for my own personal use, I've thrown it up on glorious Github/Gitlab/whatever in case this is of use to anyone else.

If you find a bug, please open an issue.

Enjoy!

### Features ###
* Exports to raw binary that can be easily memcpy'd into VRAM.
* Preserves tile flipping.
* Supports per-tile palette specification.
* Custom collision layer support.

### How do I use it? ###
```
tmx2gba [-h] [-r offset] [-lyc name] [-p 0-15] <-i inpath> <-o outpath>
```

Command     | Required | Notes
------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
-h          | N/A      | Display help & command info.
-l (name)   | No       | Name of layer to use (default first layer in TMX).
-y (name)   | No       | Layer for palette mappings.
-c (name)   | No       | Output a separate 8bit collision map of the specified layer.
-r (offset) | No       | Offset tile indices (default 0).
-p (0-15)   | No       | Select which palette to use for 4-bit tilesets.
-m (name;id)| No       | Map an object name to an ID, will enable object exports.
-i (path)   | *Yes*    | Path to input TMX file.
-o (path)   | *Yes*    | Path to output files.
-f <file>   | No       | Command line instructions list for easy integration with buildscripts

### How do I build it? ###

Dependencies for building are CMake 3.x and a C++11 compliant compiler,
all other dependencies are in-tree so you should be able to build with:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Optionally, to make it convenient for my dkp projects:
```bash
sudo cp tmx2gba $DEVKITPRO/tools/bin/tmx2gba
```

### Todo list ###
* Add support for multi-SBB prepared charmaps.
* Test CMakeLists for Windows compatibility.
* Check if this works for NDS as well.
* Compression support.
* Prehaps use GNU style getopt_long?
* Refactor & Fix bugs. *(duh)*
