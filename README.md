# tmx2gba #
tmx2gba is a simple command line utility that converts Tiled (http://www.mapeditor.org/) .tmx maps to Game Boy Advance compatible charmaps.
Originally developed for my own personal use, I've thrown it up on glorious Github in case this is of use to anyone else.

If you find a bug, please open an issue.

Enjoy!

### Features ###
* Exports to raw binary that can be easily memcpy'd into VRAM.
* Preserves tile flipping.
* Supports per-tile palette specification.
* Custom collision layer support.

### How do I use it? ###
```
tmx2gba [-h] [-r offset] [-lyc name] [-p 0-15] <-i inpath> <-o outpath>
```

Command     | Required | Notes
------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------
-h          | N/A      | Display help & command info.
-l (name)   | No       | Name of layer to use (default first layer in TMX).
-y (name)   | No       | Layer for palette mappings.
-c (name)   | No       | Output a separate 8bit collision map of the specified layer.
-r (offset) | No       | Offset tile indices (default 0).
-p (0-15)   | No       | Select which palette to use for 4-bit tilesets.
-i (path)   | *Yes*    | Path to input TMX file.
-o (path)   | *Yes*    | Path to output files.

### Todo list ###
* Add support for multi-SBB prepared charmaps.
* Test on & write Makefile for Linux.
* Export to C/ASM with width/height info.
* Check if this works for NDS as well.
* Implement some kind of grit-style parameters file for easy integration into buildscripts.
* Revamp command line arguments.
* Compression support.
* Refactor & Fix bugs.
